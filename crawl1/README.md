# WeRelateTools
Tools for analyzing and visualizing WeRelate data

My end goal is to present visualizations and other statistical explorations of
the genealogical data on WeRelate.org

I am using PHP and MySQL for the simple reason that my existing web
hosting includes those.  I am planning to use d3.js on the client
side.
